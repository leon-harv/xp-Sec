======

xp-Sec is an Intrusion Prevention System coded in PHP that detects and prevents malicious attacks on your website.

To get started, you need to place the folder "xpSec" in the root directory of your website.
Once you've done that simply add this line to each file on your website and you're ready to go.
  include 'xpSec/xpSec.php';

You can edit the configuration options in "xpSec/xpSec.php".
