xp-Sec
======

xp-Sec is an Intrusion Prevention System coded in PHP that detects and prevents malicious attacks on your website.

To get started, you need to place the folder "xpSec" in the root directory of your website.
Once you've done that, make sure that .htaccess is also located in the root directory of your website and xpSec will then be automatically included on all your web pages.

You can edit the configuration options in "xpSec/xpSec.php".
